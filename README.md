# Reinforcement-Learning-Schedulers
A reinforcement learning project for centralized scheduling in communication networks. Implements classical dynamic programming (Value Iteration, Policy Iteration) and modern RL methods (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks) to optimize user transmission scheduling with constraints on delay, energy, and communication quality.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal is to learn optimal scheduling policies using various reinforcement learning approaches, progressively increasing in complexity:

- **Lab 1**: Classical methods
  - Value Iteration
  - Policy Iteration

- **Lab 2**: Model-free methods
  - Q-Learning
  - Deep Q-Learning (DQN)

These labs are part of the MICAS912 course: *Sequential Decision-Making Processing â€“ Part II: Reinforcement Learning*.
